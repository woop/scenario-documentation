# HighInternalServerErrorRateAlert Runbook


## Overview

This alert monitors the rate of 500 Internal Server Errors reported by the frontend service. A high error rate can affect user experience and service reliability. Common causes include issues in connectivity between the frontend and backend services, recent changes in the backend such as deployments or pod restarts, or resource constraints like CPU throttling.

## Dashboards

- Grafana Dashboard: [Grafana](https://scenarios.app.cleric.io/grafana/d/bdizjrupeq29sb/demo-08?orgId=1)
- Elastic Search: [Cleric Scenarios Kibana](https://cleric-scenarios.kb.eastus2.azure.elastic-cloud.com/)


## Steps to Triage

1. Analyze logs for errors:
   - Use Elastic Search to filter logs from the frontend service around the time the errors spiked. Look for error messages or stack traces that indicate failures in communicating with the backend service.
2. Check for recent changes:
   - Review recent deployment history or pod restarts in the backend service that may correlate with the onset of errors. This can often be a cause if the issue coincides with recent changes.
3. Review the period leading up to the alert:
   - Use the Grafana dashboard to analyze the frontend and backend metrics for several hours before the alert was triggered. Look for any suspicious patterns or anomalies that could indicate the root cause of the high error rate.
4. Identify resource constraints:
   - On the Grafana dashboard, check for signs of CPU throttling or other resource limitations in both the frontend and backend services. High CPU usage or memory constraints can lead to increased error rates. Look for possible memory leaks.
5. Review backend service health:
   - Examine the backend service's health metrics in Grafana for any signs of abnormal behavior such as increased latency or error rates, which could be contributing to issues in the frontend.
6. Correlate with other incidents:
   - Check if there are other related alerts or incidents that might be affecting this service. Sometimes a problem in one area can cascade and cause issues in another.

## Action Steps

- If the issue appears to be related to resource constraints, consider scaling up resources or optimizing performance to alleviate the bottlenecks.
- If it seems to be a transient problem or one-off error post-deployment, monitor the situation to see if it resolves on its own.
- If error rates remain high or the problem recurs, escalate the issue for further investigation by the engineering team responsible for the backend service.
- If necessary, consider rolling back recent changes to the backend service to stabilize the environment.

Monitoring and early detection are key. Always consider a broad timeframe when diagnosing issues to understand the full context and root cause of the problem.
